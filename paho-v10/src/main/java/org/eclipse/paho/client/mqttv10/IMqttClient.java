/**
 * Enables an application to communicate with an MQTT server using using blocking methods.
 * <p>
 * This interface allows applications to utilize all features of the MQTT version 3.1 specification including:
 * <ul>
 * <li>connect
 * <li>publish
 * <li>subscribe
 * <li>unsubscribe
 * <li>disconnect
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * There are two styles of MQTT client, this one and {@link IMqttAsyncClient}.
 * <ul>
 * <li>IMqttClient provides a set of methods that block and return control to the application program once the MQTT action has completed.</li>
 * <li>IMqttAsyncClient provides a set of non-blocking methods that return control to the invoking application after initial validation of parameters and state. The main processing
 * is performed in the background so as not to block the application programs thread. This non blocking approach is handy when the application wants to carry on processing while
 * the MQTT action takes place. For instance connecting to an MQTT server can take time, using the non-blocking connect method allows an application to display a busy indicator
 * while the connect action is occurring. Non-blocking methods are particularly useful in event-oriented programs and graphical programs where issuing methods that take time to
 * complete on the the main or GUI thread can cause problems.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The non-blocking client can also be used in a blocking form by turning a non-blocking method into a blocking invocation using the following pattern: <code><pre>
 *     IMqttToken token;
 *     token = asyncClient.method(parms).waitForCompletion();
 *     </pre></code> Using the non-blocking client allows an application to use a mixture of blocking and non-blocking styles. Using the blocking client only allows an application
 * to use one style. The blocking client provides compatibility with earlier versions of the MQTT client.
 * </p>

	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * The "topic filter" string used when subscribing may contain special characters, which allow you to subscribe to multiple topics at once.
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The topic level separator is used to introduce structure into the topic, and can therefore be specified within the topic for that purpose. The multi-level wildcard and
	 * single-level wildcard can be used for subscriptions, but they cannot be used within a topic by the publisher of a message.
	 * <dl>
	 * <dt>Topic level separator</dt>
	 * <dd>The forward slash (/) is used to separate each level within a topic tree and provide a hierarchical structure to the topic space. The use of the topic level separator is
	 * significant when the two wildcard characters are encountered in topics specified by subscribers.</dd>
	 * 
	 * <dt>Multi-level wildcard</dt>
	 * <dd>
	 * <p>
	 * The number sign (#) is a wildcard character that matches any number of levels within a topic. For example, if you subscribe to <span><span
	 * class="filepath">finance/stock/ibm/#</span></span>, you receive messages on these topics:
	 * 
	 * <pre>
	 * finance/stock/ibm<br />   finance/stock/ibm/closingprice<br />   finance/stock/ibm/currentprice
	 * </pre>
	 * 
	 * </p>
	 * <p>
	 * The multi-level wildcard can represent zero or more levels. Therefore, <em>finance/#</em> can also match the singular <em>finance</em>, where <em>#</em> represents zero
	 * levels. The topic level separator is meaningless in this context, because there are no levels to separate.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * The <span>multi-level</span> wildcard can be specified only on its own or next to the topic level separator character. Therefore, <em>#</em> and <em>finance/#</em> are both
	 * valid, but <em>finance#</em> is not valid. <span>The multi-level wildcard must be the last character used within the topic tree. For example, <em>finance/#</em> is valid but
	 * <em>finance/#/closingprice</em> is not valid.</span>
	 * </p>
	 * </dd>
	 * 
	 * <dt>Single-level wildcard</dt>
	 * <dd>
	 * <p>
	 * The plus sign (+) is a wildcard character that matches only one topic level. For example, <em>finance/stock/+</em> matches <em>finance/stock/ibm</em> and
	 * <em>finance/stock/xyz</em>, but not <em>finance/stock/ibm/closingprice</em>. Also, because the single-level wildcard matches only a single level, <em>finance/+</em> does not
	 * match <em>finance</em>.
	 * </p>
	 * 
	 * <p>
	 * Use the single-level wildcard at any level in the topic tree, and in conjunction with the multilevel wildcard. Specify the single-level wildcard next to the topic level
	 * separator, except when it is specified on its own. Therefore, <em>+</em> and <em>finance/+</em> are both valid, but <em>finance+</em> is not valid. <span>The single-level
	 * wildcard can be used at the end of the topic tree or within the topic tree. For example, <em>finance/+</em> and <em>finance/+/ibm</em> are both valid.</span>
