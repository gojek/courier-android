/**
 * Represents an object used to pass data to be persisted across the {@link MqttClientPersistence MqttClientPersistence} interface.
 * <p>
 * When data is passed across the interface the header and payload are separated, so that unnecessary message copies may be avoided. For example, if a 10 MB payload was published
 * it would be inefficient to create a byte array a few bytes larger than 10 MB and copy the MQTT message header and payload into a contiguous byte array.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * When the request to persist data is made a separate byte array and offset is passed for the header and payload. Only the data between offset and length need be persisted. So for
 * example, a message to be persisted consists of a header byte array starting at offset 1 and length 4, plus a payload byte array starting at offset 30 and length 40000. There are
 * three ways in which the persistence implementation may return data to the client on recovery:
 * <ul>
 * <li>It could return the data as it was passed in originally, with the same byte arrays and offsets.</li>
 * <li>It could safely just persist and return the bytes from the offset for the specified length. For example, return a header byte array with offset 0 and length 4, plus a
 * payload byte array with offset 0 and length 40000</li>
 * <li>It could return the header and payload as a contiguous byte array with the header bytes preceeding the payload. The contiguous byte array should be set as the header byte
 * array, with the payload byte array being null. For example, return a single byte array with offset 0 and length 40004. This is useful when recovering from a file where the
 * header and payload could be written as a contiguous stream of bytes.</li>
 * </ul>
