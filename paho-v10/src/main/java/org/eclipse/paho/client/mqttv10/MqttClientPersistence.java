/**
 * Represents a persistent data store, used to store outbound and inbound messages while they are in flight, enabling delivery to the QoS specified. You can specify an
 * implementation of this interface using {@link MqttClient#MqttClient(String, String, MqttClientPersistence)}, which the {@link MqttClient} will use to persist QoS 1 and 2
 * messages.
 * <p>
 * If the methods defined throw the MqttPersistenceException then the state of the data persisted should remain as prior to the method being called. For example, if
 * {@link #put(String, MqttPersistable)} throws an exception at any point then the data will be assumed to not be in the persistent store. Similarly if {@link #remove(String)}
 * throws an exception then the data will be assumed to still be held in the persistent store.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It is up to the persistence interface to log any exceptions or error information which may be required when diagnosing a persistence failure.
