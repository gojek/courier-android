/**
 * Provides a mechanism for tracking the completion of an asynchronous task.
 * 
 * <p>
 * When using the asynchronous/non-blocking MQTT programming interface all methods/operations that take any time (and in particular those that involve any network operation) return
 * control to the caller immediately. The operation then proceeds to run in the background so as not to block the invoking thread. An IMqttToken is used to track the state of the
 * operation. An application can use the token to wait for an operation to complete. A token is passed to callbacks once the operation completes and provides context linking it to
 * the original request. A token is associated with a single operation.
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * An action is in progress until either:
 * <ul>
 * <li>isComplete() returns true or
 * <li>getException() is not null.
 * </ul>
 * </p>
