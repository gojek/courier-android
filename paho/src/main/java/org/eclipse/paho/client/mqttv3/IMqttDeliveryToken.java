/**
 * Provides a mechanism for tracking the delivery of a message.
 * 
 * <p>
 * A subclass of IMqttToken that allows the delivery of a message to be tracked. Unlike instances of IMqttToken delivery tokens can be used across connection and client restarts.
 * This enables the delivery of a messages to be tracked after failures. There are two approaches
 * <ul>
 * <li>A list of delivery tokens for in-flight messages can be obtained using {@link IMqttAsyncClient#getPendingDeliveryTokens()}. The waitForCompletion method can then be used to
 * block until the delivery is complete.
 * <li>A {@link MqttCallback} can be set on the client. Once a message has been delivered the {@link MqttCallback#deliveryComplete(IMqttDeliveryToken)} method will be called withe
 * delivery token being passed as a parameter.
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * An action is in progress until either:
 * <ul>
 * <li>isComplete() returns true or
 * <li>getException() is not null. If a client shuts down before delivery is complete. an exception is returned. As long as the Java Runtime is not stopped a delivery token is
 * valid across a connection disconnect and reconnect. In the event the client is shut down the getPendingDeliveryTokens method can be used once the client is restarted to obtain a
 * list of delivery tokens for inflight messages.
 * </ul>
 * </p>
